## About

__Clean-macOS__ is a simple script that can be used after a clean installation of macOS to configure and install all the apps. It uses _dotfiles_ and _shell scripts_ in order to speed up the configuration of macOS.

There are many repositories of various developers on Github, and every single one of them seemed to be very "unique". The reason for this is that _dotfiles_ are very personal and there is no "best setup".

The basic idea behind this project is that the setup and configuration of a new Mac should be as smooth, simple and fast as possible. For this reason there is just one script that prompts a menu from which you chose what kind of profile you want to install on your Mac. Each profile has different apps, options, dependencies and binaries. So no matter if you're a developer or a graphic designer, your Mac will run just fine.

## Getting Started

- ‚ùå ~~macOS 10.12 "Sierra"~~
