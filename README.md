## About

__Clean-macOS__ is a simple script which keeps updated the mac-OS or install all the stuff after a clean installation. It uses _dotfiles_ and _shell scripts_ in order to speed up the configuration of mac-OS when you have to re-install your computer.

I've seen various repositories of various people on Github, and every single one of them seemed to be very different. The reason for this is that _dotfiles_ are very personal and there is no "best setup". What I tried to acoomplish with this project is to create the simpliest setup for different kind of users: basic, developers, photographer, etc.

To do this I dove deep down into several repositories (see [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)) and found incredible ways to tweak various setup or organize things.

The basic idea behind this project is that the setup and configuration of a new Mac should be as smooth, simple and fast as possible. For this reason there is just one script that prompts a menu from which you chose what kind of profile you want to install on your Mac. Each profile has different apps/options but everyone shares a "core" function that install basic apps, dependencies or binaries. So no matter if you're a developer or a graphic designer, your Mac will be run just fine.

You can check [__here__](https://github.com/MarioCatuogno/Clean-macOS/blob/master/doc/PROFILES.md) for a complete list of apps installed with each profile.
