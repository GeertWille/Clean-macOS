#### Color scheme

Actually my favourite synthax highlighter is [__base16__](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16), especially the [__tomorrow-night__](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-tomorrow-scheme) version developed by Chris Kempson. I use his scheme for many applications, especially Atom and macOS Terminal. 

#### Show hidden variables

```bsh
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
